               <h3>Front-End</h3> 
               <p>Using knowledge of various programming and markup languages, including Python, Javascript, HTML and CSS, I have developed the skills
                neccessary for front-end develpment. Using frameworks such as React my front-end websites are aimed for with the user in mind. Making

                <h3>Economics</h3> 
                <p>Economics has also always been a passion of mine and something I have studied at Baruch College. Economics is in simple terms the study of how society use its limited resources.
                    Applications and the accesibility of technology is what drives the backbone of economics and its corresponding industries. By study economics I have seen the innovation that technology
                    has brought to the field and would like to help program these innovations.

                <p>Hello my name is Tim</p>
                <p> I'm a software engineer with a mission to create applications that make life easier. Leveraging my experience in economics and technology, I have developed collaborative skills by working with teams to create efficient solutions through coding. 
                    Together with groups of coders I have worked on various projects using libraries and frameworks such as React, Nodejs , and Django . As technology develops, whole new windows open in the finance industry.
                     My experience working using these various technologies has allowed me to see this change in action ,with the coding ability to create software, 
                     this will allow me to contribute to this innovation to make finance simple.</p>
